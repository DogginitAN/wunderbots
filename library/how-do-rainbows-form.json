  "answer_summary": "Rainbows appear when sunlight bends, reflects, and splits inside round water droplets, spreading into a spectrum of colors.",
  "answer_detailed": "Sunlight first refracts as it enters a spherical raindrop, then undergoes total internal reflection off the back of the drop, and refracts again as it exits. Because each wavelength bends a slightly different amount, the light separates into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, forming a curved arc.",
