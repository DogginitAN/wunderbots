  "question": "How do airplanes fly?",
  "answer_summary": "Airplanes stay up by creating lift with their wings, pushing forward with thrust, and balancing all the forces so they don\u2019t fall or stall.",
  "answer_detailed": "When an airplane moves forward, air flows over and under its specially shaped wings. The wing shape (airfoil) makes the air on top travel faster, lowering pressure and creating lift. Engines generate thrust that overcomes drag, while pilots use control surfaces to keep the plane stable and steer it. All four forces\u2014lift, weight, thrust, and drag\u2014must be balanced for smooth flight.",
